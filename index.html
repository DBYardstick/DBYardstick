      <p>Open-source database benchmark implementations, using less resources.</p>

<h1>
<a id="elevator-pitch" class="anchor" href="#elevator-pitch" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Elevator Pitch</h1>

<p>This project aims to implement the database benchmarks to a T, so much so that
the results obtained from these tests can pass an auditor's scrutiny and can be
published as official results.</p>

<p>Agreed that there's a lot more to a benchmark than the code to test the SUT
(system under test), but the architecture, design, quality and implementation of
the test driver code determines how many resources one has to spend on the
client-side hardware to run the benchmarks.</p>

<p>If the client-side hardware requirements are reduced, the benchmark sponsor
can spend more on the hardware for the System Under Test (SUT, a.k.a the
'database' being tested).</p>

<h1>
<a id="mission-statement" class="anchor" href="#mission-statement" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mission Statement</h1>

<p>Develop open-source implementations of database benchmarks that stick to the
specifications, allow for the variations permitted by the specification, and,
most importantly, be very light on the hardware so that running a benchmark
doesn't cost someone an arm and a leg.</p>

<a id="project-status" class="anchor" href="#project-status" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Status</h1>

<p>The TPC-C benchmark has been implemented. It is currently capable of running
100,000 clients against an infinitely fast database (implemented as <code>NullDB</code> in
code), while consuming just one CPU.</p>

<p>The code is beta quality as of now (meaning, no known bugs but there's scope for
enhancements).</p>

<p>The architecture of this implementation allows one to easily port this benchmark
application to another database, without any changes to the application itself.
To test a new database system, implement a new interface to that database
and develop the database specific transaction implementations; see <code>postgres_db.ts</code>
for an example.</p>

<h1>
<a id="decisions" class="anchor" href="#decisions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Decisions</h1>

<p>The following decisions are driven by the need to implement a highly scalable
implementation of TPC-C benchmark.</p>

<p>I had been thinking of implementing this benchmark for a couple of years, and I
was convinced that NodeJS' ability to allow easily and cheaply create
asynchronous, highly concurrent network applications was the right way to
implement the benchmark.</p>

<p>So I spent a day researching technology options and reading through  the TPC-C
benchmark (my first target benchmark). I considered following:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>One process (or thread) per terminal is not an option</p>

<p>It appears, from some of the past 'Full Disclosure' reports I read, that the
norm is to create an application that simulates an order-entry terminal, and
run multiple instances of it from multiple computers. With a maximum tpmC at
1.2 per terminal (<a href="http://www.tpc.org/information/sessions/sigmod/sld016.htm">Max tpmC Slide</a>) (because of the percentages of New Order
transactions and keying/think times), one computer simply cannot host enough
processes for the tests to deliver decent tpmC. For eg. with the default maximum
process limit of around 65,000 in Linux, we would get 78,000 tpmC, given that the
OS doesn't actually come to a grinding halt by the time it creates 65k processes.</p>

<p>By requiring many physical computers to run the TPC-C tests, it would make it
prohibitively expensive for smaller organisations to even try this test the way
the benchmark specification mandates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Node.js application</p>

<p>First I thought of implementing the benchmark as a node.js application, such
that a number of asynchronous clients would be hitting the Postgres server
asynchronously, and I can call it a day.</p>

<p>But reading the TPC-C benchmark description, it appears that terminals are
quite important a requirement of the benchmark. I guess the auditor has to be
able to see the application/terminal in action. So this idea was dropped.</p>

<p>By this time I had reviewed all unit-tests of node-postgres package, and was
convinced that this should be used. I did see some deficiencies in the tests and
code, but they can be improved. Eg. developed a patch for the tests; and the
'readyForQuery' message doesn't know the current transaction state, even though
the Postgres wire protocol version 3.0 conveys that, and there's no built-in
support for composing transactions, except holding on the the connection
forcefully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementing project using node-postgres-pure, inside browser.</p>

<p>This would require that the pg.js library be made to work over WebSockets,
and make Postgres understand WebSockets. I went back and read code of WSLAY
project (I have contributed some code to that project in the past). I also read
the message-layout/data-framing protocol of WebSockets (section 5.2 of RFC 6455).</p>

<p>Idea was sound, but as is evident, too much work is involved in making
current projects talk over WebSockets. WebSockets itself is not free, in terms
of performance; apart from the startup-overhead of HTTP Upgrade handshake, every
message has to be encoded/decoded to extract the data that is otherwise sent raw
in the TCP communication. Also, even if I modified Postgres to understand
WebSockets, later when we'd have to introduce a connection pooler (TP monitor,
in TPC-C parlance), we'd have to modify that connection pooler as well to
understand WebSockets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back to square one: application in Node.js</p>

<p>It dawned on me, why not use libpq's asynchronous API to talk to Postgres
using many connections from a single process. So I investigated that angle. But
to display a user-interface (UI) I would have to resort to one of the likes of
curses/ncurses libraries. Although using those libraries doesn't seem very hard,
managing multiple asynchronous PG connections, and tying the interface of any
one of those connections to the UI at will, feels hard. I would like to have the
auditor choose any one of the many terminals at random, and see how transactions
are progressing on that terminal; this combined with the fact that terminals are
supposed to account for keying times and thinking times, so I'd have to put many
clients to sleep for different deterministic periods, which is no easy feat if
done in C language.</p>

<p>I remembered in some recent NodeJS articles that there are now libraries to
write terminal programs. Research brought up 'blessed' and I think it is the right
tool for the job (only time will tell :). It has quite sophisticated UI controls,
and it'd allow for easy tying of a model (order-entry terminal) to a view (the
console) in asynchronous fashion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TypeScript</p>

<p>Last but not the least, the choice of language. I understand JavaScript to
certain extent, just enough to make heads and tails of others' code, but I am
quite sure it will get pretty ugly pretty soon, and it will be difficult, if not
impossible, to prove to the auditor that the code does what the benchmark
requires.</p>

<p>So I have chosen TypeScript as the language, even though I haven't coded
anything outside of its playground application. But I have great confidence in
its ability to bring clarity to a complex, weakly-typed world of JavaScript.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No AngularJS</p>

<p>After I had decided upon using NodeJS and Blessed to develop the tests, it
occurred to me why not use AngularJS Framework (or something similar) to make it
easier for model-view binding; that is, just make a change in the model, and the
framework will take care of updating the view (terminal in our case).</p>

<p>I love the concept of AngularJS because it makes it very easy to separate
the models from the view, and works almost like magic. But this magic comes at a
cost. After a little more thought, I decided against using AngularJS
specifically, because it seems to me that it compares the old and new values of
the objects to decide if something has changed in the model, which means that it
has to keep copies of objects. Since this magic requires extra memory footprint
and more CPU execution, it would incur increased latencies immediately in the
benchmark driver, and that isn't acceptable, especially when the work we'd have
to do in the absence of this framework is minimal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>License</p>

<p>I chose GPL v3 License because I agree with its philosophy. I don't want
Tivoization to limit this code being run on someone's hardware. If you own the
hardware, you should be able to run this code on it, with whatever modifications
you deem fit.</p>

<p>As of now I believe that as the owner of this project, I can change my mind
later to adopt GPLv2, if I later disagree with some of the attributes of GPLv3.
Of course, the code that was previously distributed under GPLv3 will remain
under GPLv3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not pass JSON formatted strings to and from the database</p>

<p>In Postgres, the <code>to_json()</code> and its counterpart <code>json_populate_record()</code> can
be used to marshal and unmarshal the JSON data. So it is possible to send JSON
strings to the database and make it send the result as JSON as well. That would
simplify the TPC-C application-side logic a bit because the application is being
developed in JavaScript here.</p>

<p>But I chose to not use JSON for database communication purely for performance
reasons. Making the database do something that can be done by the client would
make database performance suffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not pass user-defined types to and from the database</p>

<p>In the same vein as not passing JSON back and forth, do not pass objects
either. The serialization and deserialization of user-defined types consumes
CPU which can be put to better use.</p>

<p>TODO: The code currently in place violates both the above decisions, for lack
of time. Fix code to adhere to the above two decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code>Repeatable Read</code> as the default transaction isolation level</p>

<p>This is to satisfy the requirements of the TPC-C specification, which requires
that the <code>New Order</code>, <code>Payment</code>, <code>Delivery</code> and <code>Order Status</code> transactions
should have <code>repeatable read</code> isolation from each other (see clause 3.4 of the
specification for more details). Also, the 'Stock Level' transactions are subject
to less stringent isolation: <code>read committed</code>.</p>

<p>A transaction operating with <code>repeatable read</code> isolation may encounter
serialization errors. But since 'Order Status' and 'Stock Level' transactions are
read-only transactions, they will never encounter these serialization errors in
Postgres. So I don't bother changing transaction isolation to <code>read committed</code>
before executing <code>Stock Level</code> transaction; not doing so reduces at least one
network round-trip per <code>Stock Level</code> transaction.</p>
